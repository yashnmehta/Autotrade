CMake Warning (dev) at C:/vcpkg/installed/x64-mingw-dynamic/share/boost/vcpkg-cmake-wrapper.cmake:3 (_find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    C:/local/boost_1_86_0

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:862 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at lib/lzo-2.10/CMakeLists.txt:11 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
