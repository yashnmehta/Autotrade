This is the new price cache implementation which is listed below:

We will load the preferences of the users at the time of     initialization
then we will load the master files and based on both the things we will make the Arrays based on those master files

Here there will be 6 arrays, each of them will follow this below structures:
Array_Size = No. of Tokens(We got from the master files) x Fields(this is upto 60 fields) * 4 bytes(as most of all the fields will be int)

now those array values will be updated by the UDP receiver as the implementation of updation by Price Cache will be more hard
So the UDP reader will directly update that those fields.

Now if a subscriber subs a token, then the call will be sent to the feed handler and that will call to the mainUI and it'll call the PriceCache
here priceCache will have the base Add of those arrays and based on the index it'll just calculate the locartion of that particular token.

now that PriceCache will do two things it'll emit the QSignals, will send the latest data from the array 
now that pricecache will also send the location of that particular token

here the subscriber will have the memory Space which will save the addr. location helped for fetching the data directly using the Ptr

now that subscriber will directly access the data from that memory space for the future updates!!

price cache is like rest api call , it will serve the data to the requester , on demand basis (single shot).
